2. [Solving Algorithm](#solving-algorithm)

## Maze Making Algorithm

### Description
This subfolder contains the code and resources for the Maze Making Algorithm. Users can interactively create custom mazes using the tools provided in the GUI.

### Features
- **Interactive Maze Creation**: Design custom mazes using a user-friendly interface.
- **Various Tools**: Place walls, start points, and end points with ease.
- **Save and Load Mazes**: Save your maze designs and load them later for solving.

## Solving Algorithm

### Description
This subfolder contains the code and resources for the Maze Solving Algorithm. Users can visualize various pathfinding algorithms solving the mazes created in the previous component.

### Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Visualize algorithms like A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the algorithm progress through the maze in real-time.
- **Interactive UI**: Easily set start and end points and visualize the solution.
