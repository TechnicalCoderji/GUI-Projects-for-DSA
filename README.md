# GUI Projects for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the GUI Projects for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This repository contains two interactive GUI applications that demonstrate important DSA concepts.

## Table of Contents
1. Maze Making and Solving Algorithm
2. Sorting Algorithms

## Maze Making and Solving Algorithm

### Description
This project is an interactive application where users can create mazes and visualize algorithms solving them. Users can set start and end points and watch how various pathfinding algorithms navigate through the maze.

### Features
- **Maze Creation**: Users can design mazes using algorithms.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Visualization of algorithms like Left-Right Hand(Wall) Follower, Deadend Fill, Random Mouse etc.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface to set start and end points and obstacles.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Description
This project provides a visual demonstration of various sorting algorithms. Users can see how different algorithms sort a list of elements, observing the steps and comparisons made during the process.

### Features
- **Visualization of Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Shows the operations performed by each algorithm in real-time.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface to select and visualize different sorting algorithms.
